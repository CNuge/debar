Description: `debar` is an R package designed for denoising high throughput sequencing data for the animal DNA barcode marker cytochrome c oxidase I.
    The package is designed to detect and correct insertion and deletion errors within sequencer outputs. This is accomplished through 
    comparison of input sequences against a profile hidden Markov model using the Viterbi algorithm. Inserted base pairs are removed and 
    deleted base pairs are accounted for through the introduction of a placeholder character. Since the PHMM is a probabilistic representation 
    of the COI barcode, corrections are not alway perfect. For this reason `debar` censors base pairs adjacent to reported indel sites, 
    turning them into placeholder characters (default is 7bp in either direction, this feature can be disabled). Testing has shown that this censorship 
    results in the correct sequence length being restored, and erroneous base pairs being masked the vast majority of the time (>95%).
